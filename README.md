- **Start Date:** August 28, 2025
- **Target Date for Associate:** [Your target date]
- **Target Date for Professional:** [Your target date]

## 🛠️ **Getting Started - Setup**

### **Essential Tools Setup**
Before diving into GCP learning, set up your development environment:

📋 **[gcloud CLI Setup for macOS](./setup/gcloud-setup-macos.md)** - Complete installation and configuration guide
- Homebrew installation method
- Authentication setup
- Project configuration
- Essential components installation
- Quick test commands to verify setup

**Why gcloud CLI?** It's essential for both certifications and provides hands-on experience with GCP services. All exam scenarios can be practiced using gcloud commands.

## � Coming from AWS?latform (GCP) Certification Journey

Welcome to my GCP certification learning repository! This documentation tracks my progress toward achieving Google Cloud certifications.

## 🎯 Certification Goals

### Primary Targets
- [ ] **Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer** - Entry-level certification
- [ ] **Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect** - Advanced-level certification

### Timeline
- **Start Date:** August 28, 2025
- **Target Date for Associate:** [Your target date]
- **Target Date for Professional:** [Your target date]

## � Coming from AWS?

If you have AWS experience, check out our comprehensive [AWS to GCP Mapping Guide](./notes/aws-to-gcp-mapping.md) which covers:

### 🎯 Quick Service Translations
| AWS | GCP | Certification Priority |
|-----|-----|----------------------|
| EC2 | Compute Engine | ⭐⭐⭐ High |
| S3 | Cloud Storage | ⭐⭐⭐ High |
| RDS | Cloud SQL | ⭐⭐⭐ High |
| Lambda | Cloud Functions | ⭐⭐ Medium |
| EKS | GKE | ⭐⭐⭐ High (Professional) |
| Redshift | BigQuery | ⭐⭐⭐ High (Professional) |

### 🧠 Key Conceptual Differences
- **VPC Networks are global** (not regional like AWS)
- **Subnets are regional** (span multiple zones)
- **IAM has folder-level inheritance**
- **Organization Policies vs Service Control Policies**
